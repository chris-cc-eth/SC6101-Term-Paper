Introduction
Algorithmic trading has become apparent as the most important and significant factor that has s in the financial markets. However, much as these sophisticated systems fundamental, man has always been needed especially during the stressed moments with markets, in which these parameters are either tweaked or switched off. Nevertheless, the emergence of AMM apr items the way towards completely automation of markets and their management. AMMs work autonmously with no interaction from the user and employ deterministc algorithms for trade matching and the supply of liquidity. This literature review looks into the existing literature on the availability of automating financial markets and focuses on the capability of AMMs to mitigate the issues that arise in liquidity, price determination, as well as in ABS market resilience.

Impact
The introduction of AMMs has profound implications for the structure and functioning of financial markets:The introduction of AMMs has profound implications for the structure and functioning of financial markets:

Liquidity Provision and Adverse Selection: Kyle (1985) and Glosten and Milgrom (1985) consider that traditional market makers avoid adverse selection by means of dynamic changes in price. O’Neill (2022) indicates that despite their basic architecture, AMMs mitigate adverse selection through the regulation of size of liquidity pools. This approach is unique relative to the conventional market-making frameworks that engender inventory control with the use of the bid/offer spreads. It is worth to note that the fixed fee mechanism in AMMs addresses the issue of adverse selection risks and enables sustainable provision of liquidity even in illiquitized market conditions.

Price Discovery: Price discovery is one of the most important functions that take place in any market. Even though, there has been advancements in adopting high frequency trading techniques that increases efficiency and effectiveness of trading (Hendershott et al., 2011), these techniques still depend on the input of human beings. O’Neill’s study proves that, as seen in the example of Uniswap as an AMM, a protocol that may not be as popular as centralized exchanges becomes a more crucial part of the mechanism for less liquid coins as more large part of the CEXs may not exist. This finding is in a similar line with Lehar and Parlour (2021) who observe that decentralized exchanges are already catching up on how effectively they can discover prices, especially for new asset classes such as cryptocurrencies.

Market Resilience: The volatility has been another of the biggest impacts AMMs due to their robustness during such times of heightened volatility. Hft players usually pull out liquidity during these epochs, which in turns tends to amplify fluctuation in prices as observed by Kirilenko et al., (2017). However, O’Neill (2022) notices that AMMs were able to provide liquidity during turbulent times because their algorithms are fixed and do not permit the withdrawal of funds. This makes AMMs more sound and dependable in giving liquidity during the stressed part of the market which can have a profound impact on reactions to any rupture.

Decentralization and Accessibility: AMMs, especially in the context of DeFi present, eliminate the problem of high entry barriers. It is different from conventional market-making firms that need infrastructure and a lot of capital where anyone who wishes to engage in liquidity provision on an AMM can stake assets. Such democratization of liquidity provision could shift the paradigm of financial markets which, in turn, will become more open for a number of participants.

Conclusion
Peter O’Neill (2022) works on the investigation of the desirability and possibility of fully automated markets through the study of AMMs, which reveals several benefits of such systems in comparison to traditional market-making approaches. AMMs do not only offer a plausible workable solution for liquidity provision while eliminating the need for a human intervention but are also helpful in determining price and enhancing market stability especially during high volatile states. While this makes trading simple especially with regards to the ability to manage adverse selection, it has its limitations especially in this specific area. Given the advances in the study of AMMs, these markets can grow in the financial markets, and thus, provide a template as to how fully automated and decentralized markets can exist across asset classes. The paper presents substantial findings to advancing knowledge on how fully automate market may work and the advantages such markets could offer in terms of efficiency, robustness and access.
