# Analysis of Uniswap's Scalability

Uniswap operates on the Ethereum network, which has faced significant issues from time to time, especially during periods of high network activities. This could potentially lead to the issues listed below.

**Increased transaction fees**

Users often have to pay unprofitable transaction costs during peak times, which could make their relatively smaller sized trades not so feasible to be made on Uniswap.

The transparency of Ethereum transactions makes Uniswap even more vulnerable to inevitable front-running attacks and Miner Extractable Value (MEV) exploitations, which could also cause a sudden hike in transaction costs.

**Impact on User Experience (UX)**

High gas fees and slow transaction times may deter new user onboarding and lose the existing ones to other faster and cheaper networks. Especially for the new users, who would already be facing initial challenges of the high learning curve of blockchain applications, will have high likelihood of giving up entirely and revert back to what they're comfortable with.

**Impact on Platform Growth**

Coupled with poor UX and high transaction fees, these already existent issues could deterioriate the protocol's reputation, thus losing its customers to other more user-friendly and cheaper platforms such as centralised exchanges, which then defeats the main reason why decentralised exchanges like Uniswap was created.
