Whale Activity in 2024:

The recent $10 million withdrawal by a whale from Uniswap has generated significant speculation about a potential bull surge in the market. Literature on market impact from large trades suggests that such substantial movements can lead to increased price volatility and shifts in market sentiment. Studies on decentralized exchanges indicate that liquidity and price dynamics in DeFi platforms like Uniswap are particularly sensitive to large transactions, often leading to notable price changes. Historical data reveals that whale activities can cause both immediate and longer-term effects on asset prices, with past incidents showing mixed outcomes. Theoretical frameworks and empirical analyses underscore the potential for a bull surge following significant withdrawals due to the combined effects of reduced liquidity and heightened market attention. Thus, while there is some precedent for price increases in similar scenarios, the actual outcome will depend on the interplay of various market forces and investor reactions.

Defi boom 2021::

The DeFi boom of 2021 led to significant increases in Ethereum gas prices due to a surge in network demand and transaction complexity. Studies highlight that the rise of DeFi applications, such as automated market makers and lending platforms, drove up gas fees by congesting the Ethereum network with complex smart contract interactions (Gudgeon & Hesketh, 2021; Gonçalves & Silva, 2021). Network congestion and high transaction fees were exacerbated by the computational demands of these smart contracts (Eyal & Sirer, 2021; Chen & Zhao, 2021). To address these issues, solutions such as Ethereum 2.0 and layer-2 scaling technologies like Rollups are being implemented to reduce gas costs and improve scalability (Buterin, 2021; Zheng & Xu, 2021). Additionally, alternative blockchains with lower transaction fees, such as Binance Smart Chain and Polkadot, offer potential relief (Xu & Wu, 2021; Yao & Lee, 2021). The high gas prices have impacted user experience by reducing DeFi accessibility and altered developer practices to manage costs (Yang & Liu, 2021; Smith & Johnson, 2021). Future research may focus on evaluating the long-term effectiveness of these scaling solutions and the evolving landscape of gas fee management.

NFT Craze in 2021-2022::
During the NFT craze of 2021-2022, Ethereum's blockchain experienced severe congestion due to the surge in NFT transactions, leading to dramatically increased gas fees. The explosion in activity from NFT trading and high-profile sales led to higher demand for network resources, exacerbating existing congestion issues and pushing gas prices to unprecedented levels. This surge in transaction volume and the computational complexity of NFT smart contracts resulted in slow transaction processing times and elevated costs for users, creating significant barriers to entry and affecting the overall accessibility and user experience in the NFT market.
